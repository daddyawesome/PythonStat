# PythonStat

### My Repository for the things that I am going to learn from Kaggle

All Stat related stuff will be save here and most of them are made from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

I am using google colab because it is faster and there is no need for me to setup my own Notebook on my laptop. I can do my Data Analysis Anywhere
